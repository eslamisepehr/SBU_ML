# Regression

A regression problem is a type of supervised learning problem in machine learning where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical output. In other words, in a regression problem, the algorithm aims to establish a mapping or relationship between input variables and a continuous target variable.

Here are the key components of a regression problem:

- Dependent Variable (Target): The variable that the algorithm is trying to predict. This variable is continuous, meaning it can take any real value within a range. In the context of regression, the dependent variable is also referred to as the target variable.

- Independent Variables (Features): These are the input variables used by the algorithm to make predictions about the dependent variable. Independent variables can be numerical or categorical.

- Regression Model: The algorithm or model used to learn the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal is to find a mathematical function that, given the values of the independent variables, accurately predicts the value of the dependent variable.

- Training Data: The dataset used to train the regression model. It consists of pairs of input-output examples, where the inputs are the values of the independent variables, and the outputs are the corresponding values of the dependent variable.

- Prediction: Once the regression model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model takes the values of the independent variables as input and produces a continuous prediction as output.

- Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of a regression model, various metrics are used, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics quantify how well the predictions of the model align with the actual values.

Examples of regression problems include:

- Predicting the price of a house based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
- Forecasting the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure, seasonality, and other factors.
- Estimating the temperature based on historical weather data and time of day.

In contrast to classification problems, where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome (e.g., class labels), regression problems deal with predicting continuous values, making them well-suited for scenarios where the target variable represents a quantity or a measurement.

# Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) in Machine Learning

In the context of machine learning, RSS stands for "Residual Sum of Squares." It is a measure used in regression analysis to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression model. The goal of a regression model is to predict the values of a dependent variable based on the values of independent variables. The RSS helps quantify how well the model's predictions match the actual observed values.

### Residuals:

In regression analysis, the residuals represent the differences between the predicted values (output of the regression model) and the actual observed values. These differences are called residuals or errors.

### Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) Formula:

The RSS is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (\( \hat{y}_i \)) and the actual observed values (\( y_i \)) for each data point in the dataset. Mathematically, the formula is expressed as:

$$\text{RSS}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

Where:
- $\( n \)$ is the number of data points in the dataset.
- $\( y_i \)$ is the actual observed value for the \(i\)-th data point.
- $\( \hat{y}_i \)$ is the predicted value for the \(i\)-th data point.

### Interpretation:

The RSS provides a measure of the overall fit of the regression model. A lower RSS indicates a better fit, as it implies that the model's predictions are closer to the actual observed values. The goal of regression analysis is often to find the model parameters that minimize the RSS, leading to the best-fitting model.

### Optimization:

In practice, the optimization process involves adjusting the model parameters to minimize the RSS. This process is commonly done using techniques like the method of least squares. The parameters that minimize the RSS are often referred to as the "least squares estimates."

### Example:

Consider a simple linear regression model with one independent variable $(\( x \))$ and one dependent variable $(\( y \))$. The model can be represented as $\( \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \)$, where $\( \beta_0 \)$ and $\( \beta_1 \)$ are the model parameters. The RSS for this model would be calculated by summing the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual observed values for each data point.

**Use in Model Evaluation:

While RSS is used during model development and parameter estimation, it is important to use additional metrics (such as Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.) for model evaluation on unseen data to avoid overfitting and to assess the model's generalization performance.



# Minimizing Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) in Linear Regression

In linear regression, the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual observed values. The goal is to find the values of the model parameters that minimize the RSS. This process is commonly done using the method of least squares.

### Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model is typically represented as:

$$\[ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n \]$$

Here, $\( \hat{y} \)$ is the predicted value, $\( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)$ are the independent variables, and $\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \)$ are the coefficients or parameters of the model.

### Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) Formula

The RSS is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (\( \hat{y}_i \)) and the actual observed values (\( y_i \)) for each data point:

$$\[ \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]$$

### Minimizing RSS - Method of Least Squares

1. **Partial Derivatives:**
   - Calculate the partial derivatives of the RSS with respect to each model parameter:

     $$\[ \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_0}, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_n} \]$$

2. **Setting Derivatives to Zero:**
   - Set each partial derivative to zero and solve the resulting system of equations:

     $$\[ \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_0} = 0, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_1} = 0, \ldots, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_n} = 0 \]$$

3. **Solving for Parameters:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the values of $\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \)$ that minimize the RSS.

The solution for $\( \beta \)$ that minimizes RSS is given by:

$$\[ \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \]$$

Here:
- $\( X \)$ is the matrix of independent variables.
- $\( \beta \)$ is the vector of model parameters.
- $\( y \)$ is the vector of observed values.

This method ensures that the model is optimized to provide the best linear fit to the given data based on the least squares criterion. The obtained parameter values represent the coefficients of the model that result in the smallest sum of squared differences between the predicted and observed values.



# Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable. The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is often written as:

$$\[ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \]$$

Here:
- $\( \hat{y} \)$ is the predicted value of the dependent variable.
- $\( x \)$ is the independent variable (predictor).
- $\( \beta_0 \)$ is the y-intercept (the value of $\( \hat{y} \)$ when $\( x = 0 \)$).
- $\( \beta_1 \)$ is the slope (the change in $\( \hat{y} \)$ for a one-unit change in $\( x \))$.

### Steps in Simple Linear Regression:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset containing pairs of observations $\((x_i, y_i)\)$, where $\(x_i\)$ is the independent variable, and $\(y_i\)$ is the corresponding dependent variable.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Plot the data points on a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between $\(x\)$ and $\(y\)$.

3. **Model Formulation:**
   - Formulate the simple linear regression model: $\( \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \)$.

4. **Parameter Estimation:**
   - Use statistical methods (such as the method of least squares) to estimate the model parameters \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

5. **Model Fitting:**
   - Fit the model by substituting the estimated parameters into the regression equation.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Use the fitted model to make predictions for new values of $\(x\)$.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the goodness of fit using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, or others.

### Example:

Consider the following data:

$$\[ \begin{align*}
x & : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\
y & : 2, 4, 5, 4, 5 \\
\end{align*} \]$$

The simple linear regression model would be $\( \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \)$. The goal is to find the values of $\( \beta_0 \)$ and $\( \beta_1 \)$ that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

### Mathematical Formulation:

The estimated parameters $\( \beta_0 \)$ and $\( \beta_1 \)$ can be calculated using the following formulas:

$$\[ \beta_1 = \frac{n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{n(\sum x^2) - (\sum x)^2} \]$$

$$\[ \beta_0 = \frac{\sum y - \beta_1(\sum x)}{n} \]$$

Where:
- $\( n \)$ is the number of observations.
- $\( \sum \)$ denotes the sum across all observations.
- $\( x \)$ and $\( y \)$ are the independent and dependent variables, respectively.

### Interpretation:

- The slope $\( \beta_1 \)$ represents the change in the predicted $\(y\)$ for a one-unit change in $\(x\)$.
- The y-intercept $\( \beta_0 \)$ is the value of $\(y\)$ when $\(x\)$ is zero.

Simple Linear Regression provides a straightforward way to model and understand the relationship between two variables. It serves as a foundational concept for more complex regression analyses involving multiple predictors (Multiple Linear Regression).
