# Regression

A regression problem is a type of supervised learning problem in machine learning where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical output. In other words, in a regression problem, the algorithm aims to establish a mapping or relationship between input variables and a continuous target variable.

Here are the key components of a regression problem:

- Dependent Variable (Target): The variable that the algorithm is trying to predict. This variable is continuous, meaning it can take any real value within a range. In the context of regression, the dependent variable is also referred to as the target variable.

- Independent Variables (Features): These are the input variables used by the algorithm to make predictions about the dependent variable. Independent variables can be numerical or categorical.

- Regression Model: The algorithm or model used to learn the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal is to find a mathematical function that, given the values of the independent variables, accurately predicts the value of the dependent variable.

- Training Data: The dataset used to train the regression model. It consists of pairs of input-output examples, where the inputs are the values of the independent variables, and the outputs are the corresponding values of the dependent variable.

- Prediction: Once the regression model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model takes the values of the independent variables as input and produces a continuous prediction as output.

- Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of a regression model, various metrics are used, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics quantify how well the predictions of the model align with the actual values.

Examples of regression problems include:

- Predicting the price of a house based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
- Forecasting the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure, seasonality, and other factors.
- Estimating the temperature based on historical weather data and time of day.

In contrast to classification problems, where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome (e.g., class labels), regression problems deal with predicting continuous values, making them well-suited for scenarios where the target variable represents a quantity or a measurement.
