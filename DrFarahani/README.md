# Regression

A regression problem is a type of supervised learning problem in machine learning where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical output. In other words, in a regression problem, the algorithm aims to establish a mapping or relationship between input variables and a continuous target variable.

Here are the key components of a regression problem:

- Dependent Variable (Target): The variable that the algorithm is trying to predict. This variable is continuous, meaning it can take any real value within a range. In the context of regression, the dependent variable is also referred to as the target variable.

- Independent Variables (Features): These are the input variables used by the algorithm to make predictions about the dependent variable. Independent variables can be numerical or categorical.

- Regression Model: The algorithm or model used to learn the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal is to find a mathematical function that, given the values of the independent variables, accurately predicts the value of the dependent variable.

- Training Data: The dataset used to train the regression model. It consists of pairs of input-output examples, where the inputs are the values of the independent variables, and the outputs are the corresponding values of the dependent variable.

- Prediction: Once the regression model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model takes the values of the independent variables as input and produces a continuous prediction as output.

- Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of a regression model, various metrics are used, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. These metrics quantify how well the predictions of the model align with the actual values.

Examples of regression problems include:

- Predicting the price of a house based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
- Forecasting the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure, seasonality, and other factors.
- Estimating the temperature based on historical weather data and time of day.

In contrast to classification problems, where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome (e.g., class labels), regression problems deal with predicting continuous values, making them well-suited for scenarios where the target variable represents a quantity or a measurement.

# Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) in Machine Learning

In the context of machine learning, RSS stands for "Residual Sum of Squares." It is a measure used in regression analysis to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression model. The goal of a regression model is to predict the values of a dependent variable based on the values of independent variables. The RSS helps quantify how well the model's predictions match the actual observed values.

### Residuals:

In regression analysis, the residuals represent the differences between the predicted values (output of the regression model) and the actual observed values. These differences are called residuals or errors.

### Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) Formula:

The RSS is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (\( \hat{y}_i \)) and the actual observed values (\( y_i \)) for each data point in the dataset. Mathematically, the formula is expressed as:

$$\text{RSS}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

Where:
- $\( n \)$ is the number of data points in the dataset.
- $\( y_i \)$ is the actual observed value for the \(i\)-th data point.
- $\( \hat{y}_i \)$ is the predicted value for the \(i\)-th data point.

### Interpretation:

The RSS provides a measure of the overall fit of the regression model. A lower RSS indicates a better fit, as it implies that the model's predictions are closer to the actual observed values. The goal of regression analysis is often to find the model parameters that minimize the RSS, leading to the best-fitting model.

### Optimization:

In practice, the optimization process involves adjusting the model parameters to minimize the RSS. This process is commonly done using techniques like the method of least squares. The parameters that minimize the RSS are often referred to as the "least squares estimates."

### Example:

Consider a simple linear regression model with one independent variable $(\( x \))$ and one dependent variable $(\( y \))$. The model can be represented as $\( \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \)$, where $\( \beta_0 \)$ and $\( \beta_1 \)$ are the model parameters. The RSS for this model would be calculated by summing the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual observed values for each data point.

**Use in Model Evaluation:

While RSS is used during model development and parameter estimation, it is important to use additional metrics (such as Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.) for model evaluation on unseen data to avoid overfitting and to assess the model's generalization performance.



# Minimizing Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) in Linear Regression

In linear regression, the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) is a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual observed values. The goal is to find the values of the model parameters that minimize the RSS. This process is commonly done using the method of least squares.

### Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model is typically represented as:

$$\[ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n \]$$

Here, $\( \hat{y} \)$ is the predicted value, $\( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)$ are the independent variables, and $\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \)$ are the coefficients or parameters of the model.

### Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) Formula

The RSS is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values (\( \hat{y}_i \)) and the actual observed values (\( y_i \)) for each data point:

$$\[ \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]$$

### Minimizing RSS - Method of Least Squares

1. **Partial Derivatives:**
   - Calculate the partial derivatives of the RSS with respect to each model parameter:

     $$\[ \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_0}, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_n} \]$$

2. **Setting Derivatives to Zero:**
   - Set each partial derivative to zero and solve the resulting system of equations:

     $$\[ \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_0} = 0, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_1} = 0, \ldots, \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta_n} = 0 \]$$

3. **Solving for Parameters:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the values of $\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n \)$ that minimize the RSS.

The solution for $\( \beta \)$ that minimizes RSS is given by:

$$\[ \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \]$$

Here:
- $\( X \)$ is the matrix of independent variables.
- $\( \beta \)$ is the vector of model parameters.
- $\( y \)$ is the vector of observed values.

This method ensures that the model is optimized to provide the best linear fit to the given data based on the least squares criterion. The obtained parameter values represent the coefficients of the model that result in the smallest sum of squared differences between the predicted and observed values.



# Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable. The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is often written as:

$$\[ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \]$$

Here:
- $\( \hat{y} \)$ is the predicted value of the dependent variable.
- $\( x \)$ is the independent variable (predictor).
- $\( \beta_0 \)$ is the y-intercept (the value of $\( \hat{y} \)$ when $\( x = 0 \)$).
- $\( \beta_1 \)$ is the slope (the change in $\( \hat{y} \)$ for a one-unit change in $\( x \))$.

### Steps in Simple Linear Regression:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset containing pairs of observations $\((x_i, y_i)\)$, where $\(x_i\)$ is the independent variable, and $\(y_i\)$ is the corresponding dependent variable.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Plot the data points on a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between $\(x\)$ and $\(y\)$.

3. **Model Formulation:**
   - Formulate the simple linear regression model: $\( \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \)$.

4. **Parameter Estimation:**
   - Use statistical methods (such as the method of least squares) to estimate the model parameters \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

5. **Model Fitting:**
   - Fit the model by substituting the estimated parameters into the regression equation.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Use the fitted model to make predictions for new values of $\(x\)$.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the goodness of fit using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, or others.

### Example:

Consider the following data:

$$\[ \begin{align*}
x & : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\
y & : 2, 4, 5, 4, 5 \\
\end{align*} \]$$

The simple linear regression model would be $\( \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \)$. The goal is to find the values of $\( \beta_0 \)$ and $\( \beta_1 \)$ that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

### Mathematical Formulation:

The estimated parameters $\( \beta_0 \)$ and $\( \beta_1 \)$ can be calculated using the following formulas:

$$\[ \beta_1 = \frac{n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{n(\sum x^2) - (\sum x)^2} \]$$

$$\[ \beta_0 = \frac{\sum y - \beta_1(\sum x)}{n} \]$$

Where:
- $\( n \)$ is the number of observations.
- $\( \sum \)$ denotes the sum across all observations.
- $\( x \)$ and $\( y \)$ are the independent and dependent variables, respectively.

### Interpretation:

- The slope $\( \beta_1 \)$ represents the change in the predicted $\(y\)$ for a one-unit change in $\(x\)$.
- The y-intercept $\( \beta_0 \)$ is the value of $\(y\)$ when $\(x\)$ is zero.

Simple Linear Regression provides a straightforward way to model and understand the relationship between two variables. It serves as a foundational concept for more complex regression analyses involving multiple predictors (Multiple Linear Regression).



# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression, where the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables is modeled through a linear equation. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that predicts the values of the dependent variable based on the values of two or more independent variables. The general form of the Multiple Linear Regression model is:

$$\[ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n \]$$

Here:
- $\( \hat{y} \)$ is the predicted value of the dependent variable.
- $\( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)$ are the independent variables.
- $\( \beta_0 \)$ is the y-intercept.
- $\( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \)$ are the coefficients representing the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in each corresponding independent variable.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Independent Variables $(\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\))$:**
   - Multiple Linear Regression deals with two or more independent variables. Each independent variable contributes to the prediction of the dependent variable.

2. **Model Parameters $(\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n\))$:**
   - The model parameters represent the intercept $(\(\beta_0\))$ and slopes $(\(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\))$ for each independent variable.

3. **Regression Coefficients:**
   - The regression coefficients $(\(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\))$ indicate the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding other variables constant.

4. **Matrix Notation:**
   - The Multiple Linear Regression model can be expressed in matrix notation as $\( \hat{Y} = X \beta + \epsilon \)$, where $\( \hat{Y} \)$ is the vector of predicted values, $\( X \)$ is the matrix of independent variables, $\( \beta \)$ is the vector of coefficients, and $\( \epsilon \)$ is the vector of errors.

### Steps in Multiple Linear Regression:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect a dataset with observations on the dependent variable and multiple independent variables.

2. **Model Formulation:**
   - Formulate the Multiple Linear Regression model with the chosen independent variables.

3. **Parameter Estimation:**
   - Use methods like the method of least squares to estimate the coefficients $(\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n\))$ that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

4. **Model Fitting:**
   - Fit the model by substituting the estimated coefficients into the regression equation.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.

### Example:

Consider a scenario where you want to predict a student's final exam score $(\(\hat{y}\))$ based on the number of hours studied $(\(x_1\))$, the number of previous exams taken ($\(x_2\))$, and the average score on previous exams $(\(x_3\))$. The Multiple Linear Regression model would be:

$$\[ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \epsilon \]$$

The coefficients $(\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3\))$ would be estimated from the data to provide the best linear fit to the observed scores.

Multiple Linear Regression is a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in data involving multiple predictors. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of how different variables contribute to the variability in the dependent variable.



# Null Hypothesis, T-Statistic, and P-Value

### Null Hypothesis $(\(H_0\))$

The null hypothesis $(\(H_0\))$ is a statement that there is no significant difference or effect. It represents the default assumption or status quo. In a t-test, the null hypothesis often involves the idea that there is no difference between the groups being compared.

**Example:** For a one-sample t-test comparing the mean $(\(\mu\))$ of a sample to a known value, the null hypothesis could be $\(H_0: \mu = \mu_0\)$, where $\(\mu_0\)$ is the specified value.

### T-Statistic

The t-statistic is a standardized measure that quantifies how far the sample estimate is from the null hypothesis value in terms of the standard error. For a one-sample t-test, the formula for the t-statistic is:

$$\[ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \]$$

Where:
- $\(\bar{x}\)$ is the sample mean.
- $\(\mu_0\)$ is the null hypothesis mean.
- $\(s\)$ is the sample standard deviation.
- $\(n\)$ is the sample size.

### P-Value

The p-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it provides a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

- A small p-value (typically less than a chosen significance level, e.g., 0.05) suggests that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
- A large p-value suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

### Hypothesis Testing Process

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - Null Hypothesis $(\(H_0\))$: Typically involves equality (e.g., $\(H_0: \mu = \mu_0\$)).
   - Alternative Hypothesis $(\(H_1\))$: States what we are testing for (e.g., $\(H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0\$)).

2. **Choose Significance Level $(\(\alpha\))$:**
   - Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, etc.

3. **Calculate Test Statistic:**
   - Use the formula for the t-statistic.

4. **Determine P-Value:**
   - Find the probability of obtaining a t-statistic as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

5. **Make a Decision:**
   - If the p-value is less than $\(\alpha\)$, reject the null hypothesis.
   - If the p-value is greater than or equal to $\(\alpha\)$, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

### Example

For a one-sample t-test comparing the mean $(\(\bar{x}\))$ of a sample to a known value $(\(\mu_0\))$, the hypotheses would be:

$$\[ H_0: \bar{x} = \mu_0 \]$$
$$\[ H_1: \bar{x} \neq \mu_0 \]$$

The t-statistic is calculated using the formula mentioned earlier. The p-value is then determined, and a decision is made based on the chosen significance level.

In summary, the null hypothesis represents the status quo, the t-statistic quantifies the difference between the sample and null hypothesis, and the p-value provides a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing.



# Investigating Difference in Credit Card Balance Between Males and Females

In this analysis, we aim to investigate the difference in credit card balance between males and females. The qualitative predictor is gender, which is a nominal variable with two categories: Male and Female.

### Dummy Coding Approach

We will use dummy coding to represent the gender variable. Two binary (dummy) variables are created for gender:

$$\ X_{\text{Female}} =
\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if gender = Female} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\$$

$$\ X_{\text{Male}} =
\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if gender = Male} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\$$

The regression model to investigate the difference in credit card balance becomes:

$$\[ \text{Credit Card Balance} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{\text{Female}} + \beta_2 X_{\text{Male}} + \epsilon \]$$

Here:
- $\(\beta_0\)$ is the intercept, representing the average credit card balance for males (the reference category).
- $\(\beta_1\)$ is the coefficient for $\(X_{\text{Female}}\)$, representing the difference in average credit card balance between females and males.

If $\(\beta_1\)$ is significantly different from zero, it suggests that there is a significant difference in credit card balance between males and females.

### Example Regression Model

$$\[ \text{Credit Card Balance} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{\text{Female}} + \beta_2 X_{\text{Male}} + \epsilon \]$$

This model allows us to estimate the average credit card balance for females $(\(\beta_0 + \beta_1\))$ and the average credit card balance for males $(\(\beta_0\))$. The difference $\(\beta_1\)$ represents the estimated effect of being female on credit card balance.

### Interpretation

- If $\(\beta_1\)$ is positive and statistically significant, it suggests that, on average, females have a higher credit card balance compared to males.
- If $\(\beta_1\)$ is negative and statistically significant, it suggests that, on average, females have a lower credit card balance compared to males.
- If $\(\beta_1\)$ is not statistically significant, there is no evidence of a significant difference in credit card balance between males and females.

This approach allows for a straightforward investigation of the gender difference in credit card balance while controlling for the reference category (males). The choice between dummy coding and effect coding depends on the specific requirements of the analysis and the interpretation of coefficients.


# Three Classes of Methods in Regression Analysis

In the context of statistical modeling and regression analysis, there are three classes of methods aimed at addressing the challenges associated with predictor selection and dimensionality reduction. These methods enhance model interpretability, prevent overfitting, and improve predictive performance.

### 1. Subset Selection

- **Objective:** Identify a subset of predictors from the original set that contributes most to the prediction.
- **Methods:**
  - **Forward Selection:** Sequentially add predictors starting with an empty model.
  - **Backward Elimination:** Sequentially remove predictors starting with the full model.
  - **Stepwise Selection:** A combination of forward and backward selection.
- **Considerations:**
  - Computationally intensive, especially with a large number of predictors.
  - Exhaustive search may be impractical for high-dimensional data.

### 2. Shrinkage Methods

- **Objective:** Shrink the coefficients of less important predictors toward zero, reducing their impact on the model.
- **Methods:**
  - **Ridge Regression (L2 regularization):** Adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients.
  - **Lasso Regression (L1 regularization):** Adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients.
  - **Elastic Net:** A combination of Ridge and Lasso regularization.
- **Considerations:**
  - Effective for dealing with multicollinearity.
  - Suitable for situations with a large number of predictors.

### 3. Dimension Reduction Methods

- **Objective:** Transform the original set of predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables (principal components) that capture most of the variability in the data.
- **Methods:**
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Identifies linear combinations of the original predictors (principal components).
  - **Partial Least Squares (PLS):** Similar to PCA but considers both the response variable and predictors.
- **Considerations:**
  - Reduces dimensionality without necessarily discarding variables.
  - Principal components may not be interpretable in terms of the original predictors.

### Considerations for All Methods

- The choice of method depends on the specific goals of the analysis, the nature of the data, and the interpretability of the resulting model.
- Cross-validation is often used to assess the performance of different methods and select an appropriate model.
- These methods help in addressing issues like multicollinearity, overfitting, and the curse of dimensionality.

In practice, a combination of these methods or a careful evaluation based on the characteristics of the dataset is often employed to arrive at an effective and interpretable model.
